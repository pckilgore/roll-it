All bug fixes and security fixes are welcome without prior communications.

New features are welcome but should be discussed before implemented, and 
should be proposed with the project goals in mind. Please open an issue
to discuss your feature.

This project welcomes contributors of all skill levels, and the maintainer
is particularly happy to mentor contributors who are new to Go, open 
source, or programming in general with any contribution. But first, please
get it touch via GitHub.
